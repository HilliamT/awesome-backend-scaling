## Motivation

As an application grows in users, it can face problems that limit its capacity to grow with this demand. Bottlenecks in the system may start being observed that degrade the performance for users:

- Slow requests to load your social media timeline due to high load on the database
- Verification emails not being sent because the email-send worker is overloaded
- Timeouts being hit for API requests leading to failed checkouts

These and many more can deter users away and affect how well you meet your business KPIs.

This guide aims to collate various practices and approaches, some used, to solve different types of bottlenecks. Some may be applicable or not - take what you will.
